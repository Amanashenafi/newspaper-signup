# newspaper-signup
newspaper signup challenge from frontend mentor

- here are two html pages one for signup page(desktop-version.html) and another for success page(desktop-version.html).
- the signup page checks if the email you provided has "@" or "." and forwards you to the success page, if it doesn't it will show you an error.
